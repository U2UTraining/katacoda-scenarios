In this step, you will replace your pod with a deployment. This is a far more flexible option that allows for easier scaling and upgrading.

Copy the following content into deployment.yaml:

<pre class="file"
  data-filename="./deployment.yaml"
  data-target="replace">
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nodeapp
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nodeapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nodeapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nodeapp
        image: u2utraining/nodejs-http-server:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
</pre>

And deploy it using

`kubectl create -f deployment.yaml`{{execute T1}}

As you can see this file is very similar to the pod.yaml file you made in the previous step. The kind was set to **Deployment**, and some new properties (like replicas). 
Also notice that no name property is set in the template's metadata. The name is chosen dynamically when deploying the deployment.

Use 

`kubectl get deployments`{{execute T1}}

to verify the state.

- The READY state is showing the of replicas ready to receive traffic
- The UP-TO-DATE is the number of replicas that were updated to match the desired (configured) state
- The AVAILABLE state shows how many replicas are actually AVAILABLE to the users
- The AGE displays the amount of time that the application has been running.

Use

`kubectl get pods -o wide`{{execute T1}}

to see your pods. Notice the name that was given to it.

Let's use your proxy to verify that it's running properly. Make sure your proxy is running by using the following command:

`kubectl proxy`{{execute T2}}

Now, place the pod name into a variable:

`export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -o go-template --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}')`{{execute T1}}

Check the value:

`echo Name of the Pod: $POD_NAME`{{execute T1}}

And then do the following request.

`curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/$POD_NAME/`{{execute T1}}

That should be working.

Let's scale up the application. Update deployment.yaml to use 3 replicas:

<pre class="file"
  data-filename="./deployment.yaml"
  data-target="replace">
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nodeapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nodeapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nodeapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nodeapp
        image: u2utraining/nodejs-http-server:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
</pre>

To update the deployment, you can not use the **create** command. The deployment already exists! But you can use the **apply** command to update the deployment.

`kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`{{execute T1}}

Use

`kubectl get pods -o wide --watch`{{execute T1}}

To see the incoming Pods. Use `Ctrl+C` to stop the command. Once again you can use the curl command with the various pod names to see if they are working. Replace $POD_NAME with the pods names and don't forget the `/` at the end.

`curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/$POD_NAME/`{{execute T1}}
